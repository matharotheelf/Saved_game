* Users can restart a game.
* Users can save game progress to local storage.

## Tech Stack

## Quickstart

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/matharotheelf/taboolawidget
To see the widget run the file index.html in any browser

```

## How to Use

When on the page of the app, press "Complete Game" to complete the 'game'.

Then you can press "Restart Game" to restart the 'game'.
